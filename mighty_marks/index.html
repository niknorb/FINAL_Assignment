<h1>Mighty Marks Informational Advertising Video</h1>

<h2>This was a video I created for Mighty Marks, an up and coming digital trademarking agency from Minneapolis. This video was created through my Client Studio class at MCAD, where I worked on a team with two other students, functioning as an "agency."

<p> We began the project learning how we function as an "agency," and what each student excelled in. From there, we created our agency's values, strategy, and mission statement, which we then presented to Matt, the founder of Mighty Marks.</p>

<p>Matt told us he felt Mighty Marks lacked a strong online presence, and wanted the company to obtain 50 new clients by October 2015. Our agency then went on to create a creative brief of our values, and what we wanted to accomplish for Mighty Marks. We researched trademarking, competition, target audience, and began forming marketing ideas and strategies to help Mighty Marks obtain a stronger online presence. We then gave a second preserntation to Matt with 8 different marketing ideas he could choose from. We told Matt we thought SEO, social media, and an advertising video were his best options, and he agreed.</p>

<p>From there my two other two teammates worked on SEO and social media, and I worked on the video. This video was created to inform the target audience while also staying true to the Mighty Marks brand.</p>
